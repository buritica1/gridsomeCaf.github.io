This framework tried to imitate the way in which rugby players carry out a field formation with the objective of putting the ball back in to play again and again after just one minor foul. This formation is known as Scrum, and from there comes the term that is also applied to the development of software products, constituting one of the most popular agile methodologies in the whole world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rugby? Software? Scrum? How does all this work in our industry then? The idea consists of defining roles and seeing to the end a series of practices through a software project in a continuous and periodical way that enables the client to confirm advances at any moment, not having to wait for the entire product to be built to see it working. In other words, in the same way that in Rugby they put the ball back in to play time and time again, in our industry we obtain new versions of software constantly.</p>
<p>The job of Scrum implies the definition of a series of specific roles meant to execute the project in an efficient way:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Product Owner</em>, is who represents the client and is in charge of conveying what the idea is and how exactly the product is desired in business terms.</li>
<li><em>Scrum Master</em>,is the person in charge of facilitating the development of the Scrum process, supporting the team and making sure that everything is executed in the correct way. This is the role responsible for connecting the needs of the business with the execution of the project in terms of methodology, functions and techniques.</li>
<li><em>Team</em>, is the group of people that form the development team of individuals in accordance with the needs of the project, which will include Developers and Quality Control amongst others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now then, it’s important that you know a little about the day to day process of a team that works in Scrum. As we have stated, under this modality one works in short periods of time; these periods of time are known as Sprints and can last between two and three weeks. Each Sprint starts with a planning meeting when one specifies exactly what the task to be carried out is, in the given period. This is how the execution of the Sprint starts, where daily meetings are carried out to learn the state of advancement; these meetings are known as Daily Scrums. Afterwards a Sprint revision meeting is had which is the moment when the client can see the advancements of the product through a Sprint DEMO or Sprint Review. Finally the Sprint concludes itself and it opens the door for the next step, with a feedback meeting to highlight the positive aspects achieved and revise plans for continuous improvement. This scenario is known as Sprint Retrospective.</p>
<p>You’ve probably read in some of our posts that at Cafeto Software we always seek to work with Scrum as a development methodology, and we do it effectively as we are convinced of the important benefits that contribute to everyone involved in the project. For example, you as a client will be able to see the development of the product first hand, make adjustments to it and even use some of its features. Moreover you will be granted better control over the timing of the project as you will participate in an active way. So, to conclude one could say that in general Scrum allows for a drastic decrease in the factors that put the project at risk.</p>
