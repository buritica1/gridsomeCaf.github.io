<p>The search for the right outsourcing partner usually results in a wide range of offers in terms of rates – from those extremely cheap, to very expensive. They might even seem similar in their offerings/promises but beware of those “best rates”.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that the highest rates promise the best quality.</p>
<p>So how can you recognize which offer is the most cost-efficient for your company?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Don</strong><strong>&#8216;</strong><strong>t be trapped by the “best offer” for outsourced developers!</strong></p>
<p>When talking about choosing the best offer for the outsourcing software development, here are some recommendations for you…</p>
<p><strong>Do not choose too low rates</strong> even in countries where such rates are common. It usually indicates that those developers are underpaid and overloaded.</p>
<p><strong>Have in mind that</strong> <strong>good developers cost more everywhere</strong>. If service providers want to have high-quality developers on their team, they have to pay for them, which then reflects on the price offered to you.</p>
<p><strong>Select a service provider with competitive rates</strong>, because you can expect that this company invests in infrastructure, tools, and training.</p>
<p>There is no guarantee, but <strong>rates in a decent price range usually mean that a provider can offer highly-qualified developers</strong> with appropriate certifications and fluency in English.</p>
<p>Do not trade the quality of the savings, because in the end – such approach often costs more!</p>
<p><strong>What are reasonable rates for outsourced software development?</strong></p>
<p>From $15 to $250 per hour, everything is possible, depending, of course, on a service provider&#8217;s country of origin.</p>
<p>If you are not sure what the fair or regular rates for a certain region or country are, check our previous blog post <a href="http://cafeto.co/how-much-should-you-pay-for-an-outsourced-developer/">“How much should you pay for an outsourced developer?”</a></p>
<p>The general rule for avoiding bad experience is not to go for offers lower than $20 per hour, or for those that indicate lower rates than a common price range in a certain country.</p>
<p>Best practices show that a good ratio between price and quality for software development rates ranges from $25 to $65 per hour. This range can vary somewhat depending on a country, technology niche or experience level.</p>
<p>Anyway, in this price range, it is reasonable to expect that the job will be done by high-qualified professionals, with English fluency, updated tools, and in a good working environment, and that the results will be on the expected level.</p>
<p><strong>In conclusion…</strong></p>
<p>The price is relevant in making the decision, but it shouldn&#8217;t be the only or the main decisive point.</p>
<p>CEOs and CFOs always want to reduce costs and increase the profit, which is completely normal. It&#8217;s up to CTOs to point to the best option for having a positive ROI with outsourcing software development. This result is not achieved by the lowest, but by the most cost-efficient offer.</p>
