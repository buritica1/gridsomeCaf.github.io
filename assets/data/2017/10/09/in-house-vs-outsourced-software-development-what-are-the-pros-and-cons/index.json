Freelancers and specialized vendors are flexible to “jump in” in accordance with your project schedule and needs.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Scalability</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Every project is specific and needs a team composed according to the specific requirements. By outsourcing, you can scale up the team of professionals specialized exactly for that specific project.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Short term commitment</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>While you need an expert in a field for a specific project, you probably don&#8217;t need him or her permanently. Outsourcing IT experts on a project basis enables you to get the best only when you need it the most.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Reduced costs</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Top level professional that can&#8217;t be productive all the time costs a lot of money. Outsourcing can get you a high level of productivity at reduced costs. For example, studies show that with outsourcing the savings on overhead costs can be up to 60%.</p>\n<p class=\"lead\"><strong>5 main cons for outsourcing IT resources</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Quality control</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is much easier to control the level of quality produced when you can physically approach and speak to your software engineers than to put the vital phases of your project in the hands of someone you&#8217;ve never seen, and then hope for the best.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Collaboration</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Software development is a collaborative process. Hiring freelancers from a different cultural background can be a huge challenge for mutual understanding of specific requirements. Possible problems appear also from the language barriers, which might hinder a fluent collaboration.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Logistical challenges</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Working with a developer from a different time zone is challenging for both sides, especially when it comes to picking the time for a conference call or meeting the deadlines which are adapted to one time zone, but not to another.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Commitment to the project</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Although it sounds great to have a freelancer developer available only when you need him or her, this developer very likely won&#8217;t just sit still and wait for your call. He/she will work on other projects as well. Independent software development companies also work with more clients at a time. This might mean that your project won&#8217;t receive 100% of their commitment.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Security and confidentiality</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Companies face security and confidentiality risks even in-house. These risks definitely grow when the sensitive project requirements and details are shared with outsourced resources.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p class=\"lead\"><strong>5 main pros for having in-house software development</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Long-term product development</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you&#8217;re developing a product or a solution which will require a long-term commitment, then it&#8217;s better to build the team of developers in-house. They can be fully committed to this product, know it inside out, and easily and quickly make changes or fixes when needed.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Aligned interests</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If a company is thriving, all employees have aligned interests and share the same vision. It means that they will give their best to meet the company&#8217;s goals. Such a commitment is hardly possible with freelancers who are not fully involved in your business.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2470\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2470\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-2470 size-medium\" src=\"http://cafeto.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dancing-dave-minion-510835_960_720470-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2470\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">In-house developers will typically have a more aligned interest with their employer.</figcaption></figure></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Company</strong><strong>&#8216;</strong><strong>s culture fit</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to collaborate with people who fit your company&#8217;s culture. Having in-house developers who are nothing more than capable to do the job, but who get along with you and your team is usually more productive than trying to work with the best specialists who are a poor culture fit.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Shorter turnaround time </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Developing a product in-house enables you to monitor all the steps in the process. If something goes wrong, you can spot it immediately. Turnaround time in fixing the problem is shorter than it would be in the case of outsourcing.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Alignment with the company</strong><strong>&#8216;</strong><strong>s standards</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Control over the company&#8217;s coding standards is crucial for the future life of the product. With the in-house software development you can decide what&#8217;s best for the future maintenance processes of the product.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"lead\"><strong>5 main cons for hiring in-house developers</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Time-consuming process</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>It takes time to find the right developers and negotiate with them to join your team. And even then there is a possibility that they won&#8217;t be able to join right away. If the clock for your project is ticking, you need the right persons now, which you can get with an outsourced freelancer or specialized vendor.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Technical expertise</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Unless your company has a large IT department or an unlimited budget to hire a wide range of IT professionals, most probably you won&#8217;t be able to cover all your specific needs with dedicated experts.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Limited funds to hire a talent</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Hiring a talent costs a lot of money. Do you really need an expert in a certain field on a full-time basis? Will he or she pay out in the future, after your project is finished?</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Side costs</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Annual salaries, benefit packages, overhead costs – it all comes with a full-time in-house team.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Overload of in-house IT resources</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If the project for which you need developers is not the core business of the company, such a project could be a huge burden on your IT resources. And an overload usually results in unsatisfied employees and non-optimal product.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Trends in outsourcing</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/nl/Documents/operations/deloitte-nl-s&amp;o-global-outsourcing-survey.pdf\">Deloitte’s 2016 Global Outsourcing Survey</a>, outsourcing is expected to grow, particularly in Finance, HR and IT.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The same survey reveals that the primary reasons for outsourcing are cost cutting (59%), focusing on core business (57%) and solving capacity issues (47%).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the survey’s key findings points that outsourcing is becoming more important in enabling mergers and acquisitions deals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Did you know that Skype, Github, MYSQL and Slack were built with outsourced development?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Which side your scale outweighs in the dilemma: in-house or outsourcing?
